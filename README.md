This program contains one Pythong file called 'classifier.py'

This file has   
  1. class Model-defines the neural network model to be used for this assignment and 
  2. function train- using parameters it trains the given model and later validate the model using a different dataset
  3. functin test- test the model using a new unique dataset
  4. function classfify- takes image as parameter and classify that image using a trained model
